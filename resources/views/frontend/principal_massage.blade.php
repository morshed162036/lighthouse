                            <p>On behalf of the AIS family, I extend a very warm welcome to you. We started our
                                journey in pursuit of excellence in April 2015 and it has been a wonderful
                                experience so far; one that will be cherished by all associated with this
                                institution. We passionately believe in everything that this institution stands for
                                and its promise to be a trendsetter in the field of education.</p>

                            <p>An education of the highest quality is the greatest gift that parents can give to
                                their children. The next global generation will need exceptional academic and
                                intellectual creativity to take on positions of leadership and address the many
                                challenges that face our world. Given this, it is vitally important that the leading
                                schools in the 21st Century provide a genuinely holistic international education to
                                prepare learners for the responsibilities they will face in their lives.</p>

                            <p>The curriculum at AIS is tailored to meet the needs of the hour and sensitive to
                                learners of different types. A plethora of academic and co-curricular activities
                                offers the opportunity to all students to discover and re-discover facets of their
                                personalities. Cultural programmes and observance of international and national days
                                bring out the students’ intellectual potentials and are a platform for showcasing
                                remarkable talent</p>
                        </div>

                            <p>We are pledged to live up to the rising expectations of parents and setting a
                                benchmark in the field of quality education. I conclude my message with an
                                invitation to you to visit the AIS campus; where teaching and learning is simple and
                                enjoyable, and most importantly, within the reach of students.</p>
