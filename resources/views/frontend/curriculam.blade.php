              <p>At the Lighthouse Elementary Section, the balanced approach in curriculum designing, focuses not only on
                the students’ physical and mental grooming, but also on their spiritual uplifting. The activity-based
                methodology emphasizes creativity along with Tarbiyah as the main feature of Lighthouse Elementary
                Section. The students begin their day with the remembrance of Allah during specially prepared

              <h5>Arabic Language</h5>
              <p>Arabic language starts right from Play Group, so that the children are able to practice it by the time
                they reach the higher grades. This is considered a key to unite the Muslims all over the world and to
                understand the Book of Allah in the language it was revealed in. The Elementary students use specially
                designed Arabic workbooks, developed in-house, which help the children build Arabic vocabulary quickly
                and practice Arabic letters.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="common_pera">
              <h5>English Language</h5>
              <p>The students are encouraged to communicate in English language. The spoken abilities are enhanced
                through daily practice of phonics, whereas the reading skills are developed through an intense levelled
                Reading Program. We follow a Synthetic Phonic Program using interactive boards and tablets in the
                classrooms to enhance the listening and reading capability of students. The written expression is
                polished through a well-structured curriculum focused on appreciating creativity along with improving
                the hand writing.</p>

              <p>Cultural Studies involve selected topics from Geography, History, Botany, Zoology, Science and Social
                Studies. Exploring 2D and 3D Art stimulates creativity and broadens the mind. Painting, cutting and
                sticking, drawing, making patterns with symmetry and recycling are all fun ways to learn art and craft

                exercises sharpen and enhance the mental development of students. These activities help train the
                children to take care of themselves and their environment. Regular Sports activities help keep our

              <p>The students’ progress is closely monitored by assistant teachers, class teachers, subject teachers,
                level coordinators and the Section Head. Daily behaviour reports help in the identification of areas of
                concern, whether it is academic or otherwise and aid in planning to overcome them. Remedial programs are
                carried out for those students who require special attention in certain academic areas. If required,
                problems are discussed with parents so that they can also play a positive role in helping their child
                cope. Report cards prepared on the basis of regular ongoing assessment are sent to the parents at the
                end of each term</p>

                and conduct an Annual Training session for our teachers to share with them the new discoveries and
                latest practices in the field of education. We keep the parents involved through multiple workshops
                conducted to guide and enable them to teach and train their children hence resonating the positive

            <div class="common_pera">
              <h5>Smile & Salam</h5>
              <p>Walk the talk’ is what the Averros staff believes, greeting every student, each morning with a smile
                and greeting of peace – ‘Assalamu alaikum WRT’. This embeds the sunnah of saying salam and soon becomes
                a common practice within our students.</p>

            <div class="common_pera">
              <h5>Morning Assembly</h5>

                given the opportunity to participate in order to gain confidence from an early age.</p>

            <div class="common_pera">
              <h5>Circle Time</h5>
              <p>A recount of previous learning, moral themes and class rules all take place during circle-time.
                Subsequently, children take a peek into what is planned for the day ahead.</p>

              <h5>Tiffin / Lunch Time</h5>
              <p>Washing hands, setting the table and saying ‘Bismillah’ before enjoying favourite snacks is all part of
                the tiffin/lunch time. The teachers join their students to teach eating etiquettes; such as using the
                right hand, sharing and finishing the meal.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="common_pera">
              <h5>Material Time</h5>
              <p>The ‘Material time’ gives students the opportunity to unleash their potential by working with the
                Lighthouse Elementary Section material. Lighthouse Elementary Section material is especially designed to
                teach children various skills including better hand eye coordination, self-discipline, self-correction
                and focus while enhancing cognitive skills and creativity. These activities lay the foundation for
                future learning. It is a wonderful time for students to engage in numerous tasks with the freedom to
                choose from the available material. In Lighthouse, we ensure the availability of sufficient
                age-appropriate Montessori material to keep all the students involved simultaneously.</p>

            <div class="common_pera">
              <h5>After School Facility</h5>
              <p>Due to varied dismissal times of siblings, staff or even parents who are unable to make it to school
                on-time to pick up their children due to work hours, an after-school facility is available. However,
                this time is made purposeful for the students by engaging them in interesting activities, snacking or
                even taking a short nap and feeling refreshed before going home.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="common_pera">
              <h5>Departure Time</h5>
              <p>The security of our students is extremely important for us and so departure time is exceptionally
                organised. A pick-up card system is in place, which authorises the card holder only to pick up the
