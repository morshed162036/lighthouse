                            <p>We use the latest textbooks prescribed by Cambridge for our students. Our Library
                                also contains a collection of 37000+ books as well as international journals and
                                local newspapers. Students will enjoy our encyclopaedic archive of Audio and Visual
                                media covering a range of subjects. We always encourage students to borrow books
                                from our vast collection of fiction and non-fiction books from both national and
                                international authors. Our entire collection is catalogued digitally so the students
                                will be able to use computer-based searching facilities to find what they are
                                looking for! Grades 1-7 also have routine-based library classes every week.</p>
